# Our hypothesis is that species richness will decrease if there is an increase in impervious surfaces.
# From the plot shown, there is a correlation between Species Richness and Impervious Surfaces. 
# This shows that when there are high impervious surfaces, there is low species richness. However,
# when there are low averages for impervious surfaces, there is a high species richness. This shows that
# species richness is affected by impervious surfaces, and that our hypothesis was correct.

# Species Richness in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania:

  filter(STABBR.x == "PA", CITY == "Philadelphia") |>   # Filtering data for Institutions in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
  filter(INSTNM %in% c("Saint Joseph's University", "Drexel University", "Temple University", "University of Pennsylvania", "University of the Sciences", "La Salle University")) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = species_richness, color = INSTNM)) +
  geom_density(aes(fill = INSTNM), alpha = 0.2) +
  labs(
    title = "Species Richness in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",
    subtitle = "Observations are made by specific academic institutions located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",
    x = "Species Richness",
    y = "Density of Observations",
    color = "Academic Institutions",
    fill = "Academic Institutions",
    caption = "Data is from IPEDS and Ebird"
  )

# The hypothesis that we will be testing is how species richness is affected in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. We are testing this hypothesis to observe what affects species richness, and if impervious surfaces also plays a role in the correlation with species richness.
# We predict that academic institutions that are located in urban areas, characterized by high population density and busy surroundings, will exhibit lower species richness.
# From the plot shown, the 6 academic institutions exhibit low species richness ranging from 0 to 20, although Drexel University had high density of observations. Our
# hypothesis is right, as the 6 academic institutions are primarily located in busy areas with limited land. Accounting for impervious surfaces might change the results, showing an increase of impervious surfaces reduces species richness.
