This graph shows you the Density of observations Vs. the amerage amounts of impevious surfaces.
Less impervious surfaces transates to more available natural habitats, increasing the density of observations of birds.
This makes logical sense, more available habitats leads to more birds. With more birds, the density of observations rises.
