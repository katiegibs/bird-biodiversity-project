##THIS IS MY WORD ANALYSIS/EXPLANATION.
# I am testing if birds are more present at certain times of the day. 
# I think that birds will often be present and therefore observed more during times of daylight 
# rather than night time. I also want to analyze if certain taxonomic orders are present at
# different times than others. 
# Overall, birds are generally more active and observed during times of daylight, especially in the late morning.
# Bird observations prevalent throughout the morning and peak around noon. This could be explained by the fact that birds
# may try to avoid the heat. 
# Some orders of birds are most more prevalent than others according to the data.
