# Our hypothesis is that species richness will decrease if there is an increase in impervious surfaces.
# From the plot shown, there is a correlation between Species Richness and Impervious Surfaces. 
# This shows that when there are high impervious surfaces, there is low species richness. However,
# when there are low averages for impervious surfaces, there is a high species richness. This shows that
# species richness is affected by impervious surfaces, and that our hypothesis was correct.
